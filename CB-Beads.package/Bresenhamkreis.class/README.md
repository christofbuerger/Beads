Cirle drawed according to Bresenham algoritmus
drawn at the Display canvas.

circlePoints:radius:
gives back an OrderedCollection containing the Bresenham points which would be drawn with drawCircleAtCenter:radius:color:

want to use that to iterate over circle points to check wether morphs lie under a circle with center and radius.
